# Assessing Vulnerabilities and Reducing Risk

Modern enterprise have enormous numbers of system; it may be difficult to know where they are, who
has access to them, the connection flow between these systems. A significant security obstacle arises
from the absence of a comprehensive asset inventory. In response, organizations have implemented
scanning policies due to uncertainties regarding workflow, critical infrastructure, and the location and storage of sensitive data. The emphasis is not solely on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities but on strategically minimizing risk by prioritizing the allocation of limited resources to address the most critical aspects.

Achieving this goal necessitates a meticulous methodology, deliberate automation, and effective strategies and tactics, ultimately resulting in the establishment of a comprehensive vulnerability management program.

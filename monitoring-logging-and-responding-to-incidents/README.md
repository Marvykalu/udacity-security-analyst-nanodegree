# Monitoring, Logging and Responding to Incidents

## Scenario

Jacqui, the security analyst for Yoyodyne's satellite office in Kalamazoo, is taking a much-needed vacation. Corporate has asked me to fill in for her while she enjoys some time on the beach.

### A message in my inbox reads:

From: jacqui@kz.yoyodyne

To: me@hq.yoyodyne

Subject: hope this helps!

I found a network diagram for you. A couple years old, but mostly up-to-date!

I jotted down some notes on the usual incident handling processes, at least here in the KZ office.

I launched a honeypot earlier this week. I meant to exclude it from the alerts, but what are the chances that any bad actors would have found it already?

Sorry I did not have time to put together more info! Good luck!

## TO DO
Analyse alerts in the Intrusion Detection System, set up SIEM to collect and analyse date, monitor systems for suspicious activity, document evidence and follow the incident handling procedure to respond to any issues you uncover.

Tasks include:

Analyse Alerts from the Intrusion Detection System using Sguil
Live Packet Capture
Read and analyse Packet Capture
Create Snort rules
Use Splunk to Collect and Analyse Data
Use the Incident Response Playbook to Determine the Next Steps.

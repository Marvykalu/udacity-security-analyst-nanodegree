# Monitoring, Logging and Responding to Incidents

## Scenario

Jacqui, the security analyst for Yoyodyne's satellite office in Kalamazoo, is taking a much-needed vacation. Corporate has asked me to fill in for her while she enjoys some time on the beach.

### A message in my inbox reads:

From: jacqui@kz.yoyodyne

To: me@hq.yoyodyne

Subject: hope this helps!

I found a network diagram for you. A couple years old, but mostly up-to-date!

I jotted down some notes on the usual incident handling processes, at least here in the KZ office.

I launched a honeypot earlier this week. I meant to exclude it from the alerts, but what are the chances that any bad actors would have found it already?

Sorry I did not have time to put together more info! Good luck!
